# Changelog

All notable changes to Foremerge will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the project intends to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once its
public protocol begins releasing. Before 1.0, minor versions may contain breaking
changes when they are called out here with a migration note.
